# rtlv

Tools for reasoning about circuits in [Rosette]/[Racket].

## Collections

### rosutil

Utility code related to [Rosette].

### yosys

Interpret [Yosys] SMT2 STDT output in Rosette. Currently only supports
flattened circuits (no hierarchy in the Yosys output).

### shiva

For proving [deterministic start][notary].

## Setup

Run `raco pkg install` in the top-level directory to install the package.

## Testing

Run `raco test .` to run the tests. When possible, tests should go in the
`test` collection. When writing tests for functionality that is not exported,
they should go in a `test` submodule (see `yosys/reader.rkt` for an example).
