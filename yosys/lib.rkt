; this is a workaround for Rosette's `if` statement producing assertions
; when it's not necessary. `if` eventually calls `speculate` to evaluate
; the then and else expressions. before doing so, `speculate` appends to
; the path condition with `test` or `(! test)`; sometimes, this immediately
; results in an exception due to the path being infeasible, and so `if`
; adds an assertion that path condition implies that the test must be true
; or false (depending on which branch failed). this assertion,
; even though it's useless, sometimes gets added to the assertion store,
; because `(&& a b)`, which is used when augmenting the path condition,
; sometimes results in a concrete Racket value of `#f`, but `(=> a (! b))`,
; which is used when adding an assertion, does not simplify in Racket to `#t`
; even though it is provably so.
;
; this thin wrapper around Rosette's `if` does this test eagerly, looking
; at the combination of the path condition with the test, and if it can be
; determined that the other path is infeasible, it skips evaluating it
; altogether.
;
; this should be safe to use with arbitrary Rosette code (even code
; e.g. involving mutation).

; we could implement this with `equal?`, but that is slow. Yosys uses `=` mostly for

;
; - in the invariant function, when comparing a boolean with the literal 'true' or 'false'
; - in the transition function (this is a macro anyways, that treats the '=' specially)
